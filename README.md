Features:
            - Calcualte geometry and movement of stewart platform autonomously
            - Draw platform interactivly in a MATLAB GUI
            - Control of real Stewart Platform out of the MATLAB GUI
            - Feeding the movement calculation with sensor data from an IMU over UDP
